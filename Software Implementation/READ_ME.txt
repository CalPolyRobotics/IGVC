***GUIDELINES***
1. Put all unorganized functions that into Prototypes,  this includes code that is not adjusted for the main arduino file.  For example, your code would still contain a a setup and loop.

2. Anything that you assume will work and need to be tested, put it into the ToBeTested folder.  The file to tested should be "insertName.c" and just be a function that could be copy and pasted to the main code.  Reference the guideline.c file.

3.  For anything put into the ToBeTested folder, please update the FunctionsTest spreadsheet.  The TestedWorking folder will be updated every Sat after your code is tested.

Thanks, if there are any questions contact Jordan Lin.
